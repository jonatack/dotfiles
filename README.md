# Dotfiles

This repository is where I manage my primary dotfiles. They are a perpetual work-in-progress and are currently optimized for my professional Ruby work and personal Lisp projects.

I have put a bit of time into `.emacs`, `.bash_aliases`, and `.gitconfig`.


## Usage

The files in this repository are stored in my `~/dotfiles` directory.

They are symlinked to from their dot-prefixed versions in the home directory at `~/`. The original files are named without the dot prefix so as to not confound them with their symlinked versions, though I'm not sure how necessary that is. The symlinks appear like this in the home directory:

```bash
.bash_aliases -> /home/jon/dotfiles/bash_aliases
.bashrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/bashrc
.emacs -> /home/jon/dotfiles/emac
.exports -> /home/jon/dotfiles/exports
.gitconfig -> /home/jon/dotfiles/gitconfig
.gitignore_global -> /home/jon/dotfiles/gitignore_global
.inputrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/inputrc
.irbrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/irbrc
.profile -> /home/jon/dotfiles/profile
.sbclrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/sbclrc
.vimrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/vimrc
```

Happy dotfile-ing!
