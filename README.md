# Dotfiles

This repository is where I manage my primary dotfiles. They are a perpetual work-in-progress and are currently optimized for my professional Ruby work and personal Lisp projects.

I have put a bit of time into the `.emacs` and `.bash_aliases` files.


## Usage

The files in this repository are stored in my `~/dotfiles` directory.

They are symlinked to from their dot-prefixed versions in the home directory at `~/`.

The original files are named without the dot prefix, to avoid mixing them up with their symlinked versions.

The symlinks appear like this in the home directory:

```bash
.bash_aliases -> /home/jon/dotfiles/bash_aliases
.bashrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/bashrc
.emacs -> /home/jon/dotfiles/emac
.exports -> /home/jon/dotfiles/exports
.gitconfig -> /home/jon/dotfiles/gitconfig
.gitignore_global -> /home/jon/dotfiles/gitignore_global
.inputrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/inputrc
.irbrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/irbrc
.profile -> /home/jon/dotfiles/profile
.sbclrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/sbclrc
.vimrc -> /home/jon/dotfiles/vimrc
```
