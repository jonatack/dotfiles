# Dotfiles

This repository is where I manage my primary dotfiles. They are a perpetual work-in-progress and are currently optimized for my professional Ruby work and personal Lisp projects.

I have put a bit of time into the `.emacs` and `.bash_aliases` files.


# Usage

I store all of these files in a `~/dotfiles` directory.

They are symlinked to from their dot-prefixed versions in the home directory.

The original files are named without the dot prefix, to avoid mixing them up with their symlinked versions.
